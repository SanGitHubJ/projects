>Inheritance  >> child class can access parent class by EXTEND TO parent class
>Constructor will use to initialize parameters in class
>Super Keyword will call to  constractor from another constractor
>Overloading >> repeating same method with differnt arguments ie parametrs
>Overriding :: child class method will override in parent class [@Override key word can call in child class to make sure overriding
> RUn time Polymorphism ::
    eg: A obj1 = new B();
            obj1.show(); // run time polymorphsm

            obj1 = new C();
            obj1.show() //

>Encapsulation is binding data with methods which veriable should be private
>Wrapper class
    eg: int i = 6;  // this int is premitive data type
        Interger ii = new Interger(i) //this Interger is wrapper class.And when passing premitive data vale in side d wrapper called"boxing or wrapping"

        int j = ii.intValue() // getting ii value out/, this is called un-boxing" mean taking value out from box.

        Integer value = i //can directly assing i value to wrapper its called Auto-boxing [but run time still create object new Integer()]

        int k = value //is called auto-unboxing

> Abstract class CAN NOT instantiate mean can not create any Object[ie interface]
    and No Mothod body/ main class, all veriable by default static,non static method

> final veriable can not change once assing, and final method can nt extend n NO one can overwrite
